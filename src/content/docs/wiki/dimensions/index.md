**Dimensions** are accessible locations added by the mod. Unlike those in vanilla Minecraft, the methods for discovering each of these may vary and do not necessarily involve any portals.

# List of Dimensions

## Clan Void

[Clan Void](./clan-void) consists of 2 layers separated by 1 cobblestone block, the top layer is an endless plane of cobblestone blocks, the bottom layer consists of endless rooms, there are 9 types of rooms, a Storage Room with 16 double chests, a Disc Room with 4 double chests filled with disc 13, and 4 jukeboxes, a Hub Room with doors and signs in it, an exit room consisting of an outer layer of the "exit" blocks, a Furnace Room with 16 furnaces, and 4 crafting tables, a Crafting Room with a structure made of crating tables in it, a Stone Room with a structure made of multiple types of stone, and lastly a empty room with nothing to note of.

There is an entity resembling Null that can spawn, it will attempt to power off your computer (even on the community made "even safer version"), and spam chat if you get too close to it.

The [Clan Void](./clan-void) dimension also contains a replica of your world made with dirt and smooth cobblestone on it's underground layer.

**Note on entering: You can enter this dimension via walking close to/into a "All_Dead" block also known as a 431434 block, it is predetermined whether you'll be on the top layer or bottom layer once the block is placed.**

**Note on escaping: You will be dropped from a great height and will most likely die of fall damage if you cant break you fall, aswell as your position being changed according to how many block you had traveled inside of the dimension.**

## Null Torture

[Null Torture](./null-torture) is an infinitely extending 9x7 bedrock tunnel. On both sides of the tunnel are lava channels 2 blocks wide and 1 block deep.

While traveling through the dimension, it is possible to come across signs left on the floor by an unknown person, describing their stay there and thoughts.

The tunnel has no intersections or ways beyond its boundaries, so the player can only go forward or backward. One way or another, sooner or later the end will be reached in both directions. Ironically, what is a dead end, on the other side of the wall is an exit, and vice versa.

## Day A

[Day A](./day-a) resembles a superflat world, with growing grass and oak trees. It is possible to find floating islands not high from the surface, which are made of chiseled stone bricks and dirt. Under the first layer of grass there is immediately bedrock, separating the two layers.

The lower layer is a full-fledged terrain, consisting of dirt, chiseled stone bricks instead of stone, and quartz blocks seemingly instead of water.

## Day B

[Day B](./day-b) is a procedurally generating set of approximately 4 rooms made out of protected void blocks, doors and lights. As with other dimensions, there is an all-dirt terrain below the protected void- although protected void cannot be broken through normal means.

The consoles present in day b will bring up a menu when clicked, allowing the player to enter codes for responses. So far, the discovered responses are as follows:

| Code        | Response      |
| ----------- | ------------- |
| Null        | Outside       |
| Integrity   | ERR.NEXTNIGHT |
| xXram2dieXx | Error         |

Console interactions

**Currently, it is unknown how to access the [Day B](./day-b) dimension without the use of commands.**
