## The World They Built. The World They Hate.

<div style="text-align:center;">

*[The Broken Script](/wiki/tbs)* is a fantastic masterpiece of a horror mod provided by **wendigodrip**.

This mod is capable of running commands on Windows and Linux systems, creating text files on desktops and causing Lightweight Java Game Library (LWJGL) Alerts to pop up during gameplay.

Effectively, *[The Broken Script](/wiki/tbs)* is an ARG.

The story and atmosphere of *The Broken Script* is reminiscent of old Minecraft ARGs and Creepypastas. Most notably that of VoidExp (by mark101). However, *The Broken Script* has entities and events of it's own, the story within the Broken Script is separate from that of Mark101's series.

Frequent questions have answers [here](/wiki/info/faq).
