title: Nothing is Watching
---

## Appearance

A rectangular black censor box with nothing behind it. In some
instances, its sprite will shake while idling or moving.

## Behaviour

Nothingiswatching will appear on the ground nearby a player and watch
them. Upon spawning, null.curious can be read in the subtitles.
Observing Nothingiswatching directly for a few seconds or getting too
close will result in it chasing after the player, locking their camera
onto the entity and causing black glitchy artifacts to appear on screen.
Getting hit by it will crash the game.

In some instances, Nothingiswatching will follow its target player
around until they either get too close or look directly at it. Rarely,
it will vanish instead of attacking when looked at.

# Notes

1.  While chasing, Nothingiswatching is capable of breaking blocks and
    harming entities in its path.
