title: "Null"
---

**Null** is a player-like entity and one of the parts of 0nullvoid0's
soul.

His intentions are currently not clear, but according to himself, he
wants freedom.

## Appearance

Humanoid, player-like entity with a solid pitch-black skin.

## Behaviour

Null will join the game (visible in chat) early into the play-through
and will appear in the tab list. After he joins, he can start to appear
in the player's world - usually indicated by a static sound cue and the
[err.null](/wiki/mechanics/errsleep) error message if they try to sleep.
Null can engage in a number of different behaviours, listed below:

### Stalk

Null will appear on the ground and look at the player. Looking directly
at him or getting too close will result in one of seven things
happening:

  - He vanishes with no other effects.
  - He vanishes and deals a small amount of damage to the player.
  - He vanishes with a lightning strike where he stood.
  - He vanishes and inflicts the player with blindness.
  - He sends the player to [Null Torture](/wiki/dimensions/null-torture).
  - He switches to Scare behaviour.
  - He switches to Chase behaviour.

Occasionally, after disappearing, Null will change the time of day.

### Flying

Null will float in the sky, observing the player. Approaching him by
stacking up or bridging towards him will result in one of the same
reactions as with his grounded form. When he spawns in this behaviour,
eerie music will begin playing.

### Endgame

Null will teleport in front of the player, spamming the chat and causing
extreme glitching as "HERE I AM" is spammed across the players' screens,
ultimately turning off their PC.

### Null is here

Null will begin rapidly closing distance with the player, teleporting
short distances towards them. During this text lines flash in the middle
of the player’s screen. Getting hit by Null will ban the player
permanently if safemode is not enabled.

### Chase

Null will chase the player and attack them. During this, the player’s
camera will be locked on him and he will be surrounded by black squares
particles. Getting hit by Null will kick the player with a "null" error
message.

Surviving the chase will result in Null switching to his "Null is here"
behaviour.

### Scare

Null will appear in front of the player, jumpscaring them. During this,
text messages will be flashing in the middle of the player's screen.
Getting hit by Null will ban the player from the world permanently if
safemode is not enabled.

### Mining

Null will appear somewhere underground with a full set of iron armor and
an iron pickaxe, mining and bridging towards the player. When he damages
the player, he will disappear and play an audio file saying "You will
become one of us".

### Nether Mining

It seems that occasionally, Null is also able to appear in the Nether in
iron armor, rapidly mining blocks near the player as well as placing
cobblestone while approaching them. It is currently unknown if his
Nether mining behavior otherwise lines up with his overworld mining
behavior; he doesn't seem to chase the player if they jump into lava and
will disappear after a moment. Null's mining area appears hard to
traverse, trapping the player's movement in a way comparable to the
[ghost blocks area phenomenon](/wiki/mechanics/random-events#ghost-blocks-area).

## Reputation System

There is a reputation system that so far isn't fully understood but it
seems to determine whether Null will give the player gifts and
presumably entity/event spawnrates. There is currently 3 reputation
statuses: Good, Neutral, and Bad.

#### Good

So far in this status Null will give the player a chest containing
diamonds at random, its unknown if he can give other gifts in the
current version.

#### Normal

Normal conditions but actual effects are unknown.

#### Bad

This status isn't fully understood either but its thought that
entity/event spawn rates increase or get more intense.

## Dialogue

In the 1.8 version of the Broken Script it was required for the players
to be within a certain vicinity of Null watching to interact with him.
It no longer seems to be the case in version 1.9. There are seemingly no
conditions and responses are based off what the player says in chat.

The following interactions are capable of taking place, and are arranged
in a table. Expand the table at your own risk, as it contains heavy
spoilers.

## Notes

1. It's theorized that Null's name reminds him of who he has become, which he hates. Notably, he reacts with the same amount of vitriol at the mention of xXram2dieXx.
2. There is a popular creepypasta of the same name, [Null](https://minecraftcreepypasta.fandom.com/wiki/Null) However, the one from the Broken Script seems to be only related in name.
3. You can glitch null by typing "Fuck you" and then pasting "Friend?", you'll need a friend for that to do so. The spawned glitched null is named "\[\]" and has a 3 blocks in height hitbox.
4. Null is confirmed to be 14 years old.
