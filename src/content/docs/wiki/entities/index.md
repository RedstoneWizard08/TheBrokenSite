title: Entities
---

**Entities** within [The Broken Script](../tbs) range from player-like to non-euclidean horrors of the void made of geometry or cables/wires. Many of them are hostile, some are conditionally hostile dependant on player reaction to their presence (ie. looking at them, attacking them, drawing too close to them, etc.). Abilities and behaviour can differ between entities, though the most severe conclusion to an interaction with an entity from The Broken Script is the banning of the player from their own world.

Most entities spawn naturally in the overworld depending on a few variables and conditions. Some, present within the mod's files, are not included into a world's natural spawnrate and must be summoned either through a chat command or a command block.

For the sake of wiki categorization we will maintain this page as the page for Entities found within the mod. However, let it be clear that there is a very explicit distinction between the wiki's categorization of a minecraft entity and what *defines* an 'entity' in the TBS.

Notably, all entities, with the exception of the Void Creatures, appear to have formerly been players who were transformed into what they are in one way or another, whether through corruption, interaction with Void Creatures, or otherwise.

Not all transformed players end up similar to each other, or even what they were before, ultimately varying widely not only in appearance but also in their power, capabilities, and consciousness. The criteria by which a player is determined to be what type of entity after transformation are currently unknown.

## Souls

**Souls** are entities that have retained their consciousness after
transformation. They appear to retain memories and knowledge they had
prior, and are still able to think, more or less, and express
themselves.

Judging by Null, it can be said that souls are able to understand and
process everything that has happened and is happening, but are not able
to influence anything and free themselves. Ultimately having control
only over their body within the game and being only conscious while
eternally imprisoned in Minecraft.

Only one soul is known.

## Entities

This classification is for players who have suffered a fate worse than
death and been warped into, seemingly, monsterous presences.

// TODO

## Anomalies

Classified as players who have also been warped beyond recognition, but
not as powerful as the entities, for the most part, it seems Anomalies
are not outwardly hostile, but relatively benign in their presence.

// TODO

## Void Creatures

[The Broken Script](../tbs) is antagonized by a trio of **Void Creatures**, as the name implies, these entities originate from the Void. They are considered the highest level threat in The Broken Script as encounters with them often end in the player's demise one way or another.

Through unknown means and under unknown conditions, Void Creatures are seemingly able to crawl out of the game and into the real world, at least through the monitors of computers under the influence of the Void.
