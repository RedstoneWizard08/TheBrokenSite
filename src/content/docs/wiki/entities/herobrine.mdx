**Herobrine** from the creepypasta and legends seems to exist within the
Broken Script. How he came to be, what his intentions are, and who his
afilliations are with is unknown.

## Appearance

A player-like entity with a darkened Steve skin and iconic glowing white
eyes.

## Behaviour

Herobrine appears on the ground and watches the player from afar.

On attempt to get closer to him, he will simply disappear without doing
anything.
