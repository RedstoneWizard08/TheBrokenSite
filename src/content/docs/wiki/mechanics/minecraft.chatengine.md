title: minecraft.chatengine

Certain entity encounters cause Minecraft's chat engine to fail,
preventing chat messages from being sent and causing the following error
messages:

IMPORT minecraft.chatengine

Unexpected_error.returnedvalue=-1

What is understood about this error is that it has occurred on the
"*server*" before, as the previous players left a sign in an old
[clan_build](clan_build "wikilink"), commenting then, "Why chat wonâ€™t
work?".

The following entities are currently known to be able to do this:

  - [The Broken End](The_Broken_End "wikilink")
  - [Siluet](Siluet "wikilink")

[Category:Mechanics](Category:Mechanics "wikilink")
